# # Welcome to Jekyll!
# #
# # This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# # which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# # yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# # feature for the data you need to update frequently.
# #
# # For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# # 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# # Site settings
# # These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# # you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# # You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# # in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# title: Your awesome title
# email: your-email@example.com
# description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
#   Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
#   line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
#   Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.

# url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
