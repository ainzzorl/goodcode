## Context

Leela Chess Zero (abbreviated as LCZero, lc0) is a chess engine designed to play chess via neural network, specifically those of the [LeelaChessZero](https://lczero.org/) project. Lc0 is considered one of the strongest chess engines in the world.

The reader is expected to know the rules of chess.

## Problem

A chess engine needs to represent the chess board. Board representation is fundamental to all aspects of a chess program including move generation, the evaluation function, and making and unmaking moves (i.e. search) as well as maintaining the state of the game during play.

In this article we only focus on the representation, leaving aside other aspects of the engine such as evaluation, search, etc.

## Overview

Lc0 has the [`ChessBoard`](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/blob/4d89f0870dfe3a33cac36c4d9f2850fcb4e0c179/src/chess/board.h#L60-L272) class representing a chess position. it makes heavy use of [BitBoards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards) to store piece positions. It defines methods like `GeneratePseudolegalMoves`, `ApplyMove`, `IsUnderAttack`.

Some terms necessary to understand the code:

- Bitboard ([Chess Programming](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard)) - bit array data structure, where each bit corresponds to a game board space. This allows parallel bitwise operations to set or query the game state, or determine moves or plays in the game. It's often abbreviated as _BB_ in the code.
- [Ply](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ply_(game_theory)>) - one turn taken by one side.
- [50 move rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-move_rule) - states that a player can claim a draw if no capture has been made and no pawn has been moved in the last fifty moves.
- [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) - Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.
- [Pseudo-legal move](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Pseudo-Legal_Move) - is legal in the sense that it is consistent with the current board representation it is assigned to, but may still be illegal if they leave the own king in check.
