## Context

Leela Chess Zero (abbreviated as LCZero, lc0) is a chess engine designed to play chess via neural network, specifically those of the [LeelaChessZero](https://lczero.org/) project. Lc0 is considered one of the strongest chess engines in the world.

The reader is expected to know the rules of chess.

## Problem

A chess engine needs to represent the chess board. Board representation is fundamental to all aspects of a chess program including move generation, the evaluation function, and making and unmaking moves (i.e. search) as well as maintaining the state of the game during play.

In this article we only focus on the representation, leaving aside other aspects of the engine such as evaluation, search, etc.
