    A <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/articles/jest-test-sequencer">new article</a> about ordering tests in <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> has been added to the catalog.
  </p>

  <p>
      The code is written in TypeScript and attempts to improve user-perceived responsiveness and speed of the test run. It's achieved by prioritizing tests that failed during the last run and slower tests.
