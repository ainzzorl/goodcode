A [new article]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/jest-diff) about displaying diffs in [Jest](https://jestjs.io) has been added to the catalog. This is our second article featuring Jest after [Jest - Test Sequencer]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/jest-test-sequencer).

We discuss how Jest shows human-readable diffs between the expected and the actual values when test assertions fail. We review the main flow of diffing two JavaScript objects, but not the underlying sequence difference implementation, which is based on the Myers algorithm.

The code is written in TypeScript.
