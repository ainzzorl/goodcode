    A <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/articles/protobuf-tokenizer">new article</a> about tokenizing <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol Buffers</a> has been added to the catalog.
  </p>

  <p>
      This code was written in C++ back in 2008, and it's still used very widely at Google and outside. What stands out about it are how thoroughly the design decisions are documented and the personal tone of the comments.
