A [new article]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/vscode-skip-list) about skip list implementation in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been added to the catalog.

[Skip List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) is a probabilistic data structure that can be used instead of balanced trees in most applications. Unlike other data structures with similar performance, like [Red-black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), skip lists are notoriously easy to understand and implement.

The code is written in TypeScript.
